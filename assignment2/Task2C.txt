When encryption is applied, the request data, including the URL path, headers, and other metadata, is scrambled into an unreadable format that only the intended recipient can decrypt. This means that even if an attacker captures the network traffic, they would not be able to see the exact resource being requested, such as "/public/img/gears.gif," or any sensitive data included in the request. Instead, they would only see encrypted packets, protecting the integrity and confidentiality of the communication between the client and server.
