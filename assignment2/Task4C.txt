One effective way to combat ARP spoofing attacks is enabling Dynamic ARP Inspection (DAI) on network switches, which verifies ARP packets against a trusted database to prevent spoofing. Another method is implementing static ARP entries for critical devices, ensuring that only legitimate MAC addresses are used. Additionally, using VPNs or encrypted communication protocols like HTTPS reduces the risk of man-in-the-middle attacks stemming from ARP spoofing. Regularly monitoring ARP tables with tools like ARPWatch or Wireshark can help detect anomalies. Finally, segmenting networks using VLANs and ensuring proper firewall rules further limit the attack surface, making it more difficult for attackers to exploit ARP vulnerabilities.
